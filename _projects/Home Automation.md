**"Technology can be our best friend, and technology can also be the biggest party pooper of our lives."**

*-- Steven Spielberg*

Our lives have become tech-centric. Today, we are increasingly being ruled by our technologies rather than the other way around. It’s starting to “own” us. 

How can we be more mindful around our technology ?

We need to be intentional with our use of technology. We should make room - space and time - for the things we love and eliminate everything that distracts us from them.

**"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.”**

*-- Albert Einstein*

It’s time to seek ways to redesign our relationship with technology. 
#### We at Digihomz can help simplify technology and make it work for you intuitively so it blends with your lifestyle. We design systems that seamlessly and fluidly interact to give you more control over your surroundings so you can concentrate on the important things in your life such as loving relationships, family time and your passions.

**"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”**

*-- Leonardo da Vinci*
