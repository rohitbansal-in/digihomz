**Why home cinema when there is a multiplex nearby ?**

A well-built &  well-programmed home cinema system, has the potential to vastly outshine the movie-watching experience at the average local cineplex. Apart from the *3 C's* - **comfort**, **convenience**, and **customization**, a well-calibrated home Theater will produce **superior picture** with better *black levels & brightness* and **crystal clear sound** *tuned to exact standards*.

#### We design & install Home Cinemas & Media Rooms for new / existing constructions as per THX guidelines. Our Audio & Video Calibration ensures that movies are presented in a manner - 

#### *'As the Director intended'*

Trust us to help you recreate the same magical experience at every seat in your home theater - free from distraction & fatigue, just as it was created in the studio.
